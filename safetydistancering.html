                As part of a daily life activity, driving was chosen for this project. Driving is one of the most common daily activity for urban people and yet, the scenario of driving in India is not convinient. Due to lack of following traffic rules, poor training and other various reasons, driving has proved to be fatal. It is second major reason of deaths in India. Therefore, in this project I tried to focus on the problem areas in driving and how some of the issues can be solved using ubiquitous computing.

                I took a qualitative approach to understand and identify problems in a daily activity. This approach gave me deeper insight into problems we usually ignore on daily basis.

            < p class=""> The issue of Safety Distance in Mixed traffic</p>

            <p class="content">
                From the research, the issues of maintaining safety distance  leads to anxiety and stress while driving. This issue arises due to the mixed-traffic condition on Indian Roads. Due to poor management and control by authorities, vehicles usually don’t follow the safety distance rule and instead try to overtake which might lead to fatal accidents. This kind of driving might also hurt the pedastrian who are walking on the roads.<br><br>
                
                The research also highlighted this issue is noticable amongst the new drivers but the experienced drivers have got used to it. Due to this reasons, this has become a habit and is extremely difficult to change by enforcing just traffic rules.<br><br>

                The picture below depicts a typical scenario of a busy street with mixed-traffic.

            <p class="content">
            Safety Distance is one of the major issues in mixed-traffic. Pedastrian and Two-wheelers are at higher risk and the situation worsens during night. The risk of hitting can be reduced if the driver can be notified or warned against breaking the safety distance. Here lies the biggest challenge about how to notify a driver when he is still driving.<br><br>
            
            <b>Understaning Human Vision to decide design parameters : </b><br>
            For designing such a solution, it was necessary to understand how we use our vision during driving. From "blah blah paper", I came to know that a human uses both her peripheral and foveal vision to ancipate the obstacles and other vehicles on the road. THerefore I studied merits and shortcomings of both vision and tranformed them into my groundrules for the design.<br>

                Data is visualised based on user’s viewing direction. Data in central vision is displayed in detail. Data which lies in peripheral vision are highlighted by movement and change in brightness as well as amount of detail and size. This concept of perifoveal display can be helpful in case of driving. Information can be prioritised and placed in foveal and peripheral vision respectively.<br>

            I created a video for an experiential prototype. But due to limitation on screensize the vision is  restricted and everything appears on focus. Therefore I have decided to create an <b>interactive virtual reality environment</b> where I can simulate the experience in a virtual environment. The viewers can visually interact with the Safety Distance Ring based on their point of focus inside VR.<br><br>

            <b>The final prototype is a work in progress.</b>
